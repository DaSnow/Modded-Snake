# What it can do out of the box
After compiling and running the project for the first time, you should be able to do a couple of things:

key inputs available
-'g' = Highlights shortest path to fruit (usually works).
-'b' = Stores power up.
-'a' = Increase score by 10.
-'u' = Reduces snake body by 1 segment.

## Snake
It's snake. Fun. Also You can stack power ups.

## Additional Notes
For some reason on my partner's computer the speed power up skipped collision with fruit and entities at times, but mine did not.
